      <description>On Chromecasts and Slack Background Okay, first a little background. We - at Bagaar - are involved in all things digital. By nature many of us are interested in discovering new things, that includes music, lots of music. Therefore we had built a Slack integration that checked the &amp;lsquo;current DJ&amp;rsquo; at the office Last.fm scrobbles and posted them to a Slack channel for all to see. This worked fine while we were using an Apple Airport and Airplaying our tunes with Spotify.</description>
